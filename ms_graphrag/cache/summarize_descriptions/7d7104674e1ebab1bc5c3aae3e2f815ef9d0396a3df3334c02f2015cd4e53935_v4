Tensions have escalated between them, particularly highlighted during a recent argument related to personal matters, which influenced the dynamics of their interactions. This conflict has had a profound impact on how they engage with each other, especially amid an investigation concerning various events that unfolded around a ferry.\n\nBoth Liam and Marcus were involved in these ferry-related incidents, and their interactions took a turn for the worse as Liam threatened Marcus over issues related to potentially incriminating knowledge and motives. This threat has further intensified the atmosphere between them, suggesting that their relationship is not merely one of rivalry but also enmeshed in legal and moral implications, particularly surrounding customs operations. Liam's mention of customs fees has created a connection with Marcus, indicating that their disputes may span beyond personal grievances to involve broader logistical concerns.\n\nThe relationship between Liam and Marcus is marked by a web of responsibility and consequence. Liam's actions, notably threatening Marcus, and the subsequent developments concerning their interactions play a critical role in the narrative surrounding the events linked to the ferry. This connection is underscored by the fact that Marcus was seen arguing with Liam shortly before a tragic incident where Liam went overboard, implying that their conflict may have directly contributed to the unfolding tragedy.\n\nMoreover, the argument that occurred shortly before the incident suggests a climactic buildup of tensions that were already present, making it clear that the relationship between Liam and Marcus was not only contentious but also pivotal to understanding the events that transpired.
