The harbour looks electric — and I don’t mean the lights. Circular Quay, Wharf 3, 6pm. Don’t be late.
On shift. Can slip us onto the 6:30 Manly ferry. Best view of the city turning on.
If we’re playing tour guide, someone better bring some decent gossip. I’ve got a lead that's burning a hole in my notes.
Save it for another time, Zoe. Let’s just try to enjoy the lights for what they are.
Come on now, a truce for tonight. I’m determined to get photos of the Opera House sails from mid-harbour.
I’m in. Clinic ran late so I have to leave by 8. Long day.
Let's meet by the bronze seal statue. It's easier to spot in the crowd.
I’ll bring my tiny recorder. The ambient sounds of the ferry make for great B-roll. You never know.
Bringing fingerless gloves. It’s freezing but I refuse to hide my new nails. A girl has her priorities.
I can grab some ginger tablets on my way. Seasick prevention for the weak-willed among us.
Ha. Just wait till a southerly hits. You’ll be worshipping those little tablets then.
Text me if you’re running behind. I still have to return some scrubs first.
DM: You saw Marcus’s Harbour Consulting transfer, right? Meet me at Wharf 3. Quietly.
DM: I’ve got a clipped invoice name: INV‑HC‑041 — “curation services.”
DM: Don’t put that in writing. Meet you at Wharf 3. We need to talk.
DM: Bring that USB you borrowed. I need it back tonight. No excuses.
DM: You said it was just backup photos from the hackathon. Why the sudden rush?
Heads up: the ferry's delayed. Some alarm went off earlier at the quay. We should be good for 6:45 now.
PA just asked folks to move forward for boarding checks. Stern deck is pretty empty right now.
Busker on the quay has a crowd facing away from Wharf 3. Good window for the crew to reset things.
I'm at Wharf 3 under the big clock. The wind is absolutely freezing out here.
Here with hot chips. Don't be late or they'll be gone. Sharing is caring, but I have my limits.
There's a street busker outside the Museum of Contemporary Art playing Crowded House. Quintessentially Sydney.
Just snapped the Harbour Bridge through a puddle. A perfect reflex mirror of steel and sky.
The queue at Wharf 3 is long but it’s moving. I’ll hold a few spots for us.
Wave if you see me. I'm in the high-vis jacket and a blue beanie. Can't miss me.
Buying a scarf from the kiosk. This wind is savage. I should have dressed warmer.
Extra chips for sharing. No flaking on me now, people.
A ferry horn just made a kid cry and then immediately laugh. I kind of know the feeling.
Noticing a fire boat near the quay. Lights are on but no siren. Strange.
Onboard now, top deck. The city looks electric from here. Truly something else.
Smells like salt and something metallic, like battery acid. I love it.
Stay clear of the yellow lines, everyone. The deck gets surprisingly slick out here. Safety first.
Recorder is rolling. Say something poetic for me, Sienna. Don't be shy.
The sails are breathing tonight.
That’s poetic enough. Just don’t drop that expensive recorder overboard.
Also, for your information: that USB is encrypted. Marcus, what’s actually on it? This is getting weird.
Drop it. Enjoy the view.
Forget the drive. The sails look like they’re breathing tonight. It’s unreal.
Someone’s left a backpack under the bench by the stern. Anyone see who it belongs to?
Photo attached: It’s a black canvas bag, with paint flecks on the strap. Looks familiar.
Did anyone see who might have left it there? We should probably let someone know.
Probably just a tourist. Leave it for lost property. I’ll log it when we dock. No stress.
DM: Want me to move it closer to the wall, out of the way?
DM: Nah, just leave it exactly where it is. I’ll tag it properly later. Thanks though.
Focus, people: the fireworks reflection on the glass towers. That's some unreal bokeh. A photographer's dream.
DM: Your hands are shaking. Are you okay? You seem on edge.
DM: It’s been a long shift. The wind just cuts right through you out here on the water.
DM: So, are we good for that package or not? I need to know.
DM: Not over text. We'll talk about it later. End of discussion.
Okay, quick group photo and then everyone pockets their phones. Let's live a little, shall we?
Timer is set for 3 seconds. Everyone squeeze in and try to look happy!
The wind just stole my beanie. A seagull owes me $20. The audacity.
Posting to our chat only. No public tags, please. Let's keep this one for us.
The harbour is glassing over now. The reflection looks like it’s breathing. So serene.
DM: You and your beautiful metaphors. Keep them coming. They're the highlight of my night.
The ferry just slowed down near Kirribilli. There are police lights along the shore. What’s going on?
Marcus, where did you disappear to? You were just here.
He’s on the lower deck. He said he was feeling sick all of a sudden.
I’m fine, really. Just needed some fresh air and fewer pointed questions. It was getting intense.
DM: Keep an eye on that bag. A crew member keeps glancing at it. Something's not right.
DM: Which one? The one with the yellow gloves and the shaved head?
DM: Yep, that's the one. He's the same guy Liam was chatting with earlier. I have a bad feeling.
The wind’s really picking up now. Hold onto the rails if you’re moving around. Seriously.
The Opera House is behind us now. The bridge towers look like ancient watchmen in the dark.
I still can’t unlock this USB. It keeps asking for a passphrase. What are you hiding, Marcus?
Try ‘HarbourLights’. It’s worth a shot. People are often predictable.
No luck. Phrase prompt persists. Strong encryption.
DM: Delete anything and everything you saw. Please. For your own good.
DM: What in the world did you drag us into, Marcus? This is serious.
DM: Not here. People listen on boats. Bring the USB tomorrow. We need to talk, face to face.
DM: He’s completely dodging. If I suddenly vanish, publish everything you have. I’m not kidding.
DM: Don’t be so dramatic. But yes, everything is backed up. I've got your back.
Did anyone else just feel the ferry lurch a bit? That was a strange jolt.
Wait, where’s Liam? Has anyone seen him in the last few minutes?
I thought he went to talk to the captain about something. He looked stressed.
There’s a jacket by the rail near the stern. It looks just like his. Oh my god.
Call triple zero right now! Someone’s gone overboard! This is not a drill!
I’m pulling the emergency alarm right now. Stay calm, everyone.
Throw the ring buoy! Port side! I can’t see him in the water. It’s too dark.
Triple zero is on speaker. They’re alerting the Marine Area Command immediately. Help is on the way.
The crew is deploying a ladder. I’m scanning the water with my flashlight. The waves are like black glass.
I hear a strange banging sound from below. Is it the engine room? Or the hull slapping against something?
I’m on the lower deck, starboard side. No sighting of him yet. I'm looking as hard as I can.
They’re bringing someone up onto the deck. It’s Liam. He looks… oh god.
I’m with the crew now. I'm starting compressions. Give us some space, please!
His pupils are unresponsive. There's no pulse. I… I’m so incredibly sorry, everyone. He's gone.
The crew is logging the incident time. Approximately 19:05. Cold shock was likely a factor. Keep the space clear.
Recording incident details. Footing slick at stern rail.
There’s a thin, sharp mark on his wrist. It looks like a fishing line burn. How did that get there?
DM: Marcus was arguing with him by the stern no more than ten minutes ago. I saw it.
DM: I saw a fresh bruise on Liam’s wrist earlier tonight. I should have said something.
DM: That lines up with the sharp snap I think I heard on my recording. Save all your notes. Every detail matters now.
Cover him with blankets. Please, keep the curious onlookers back. Show some respect.
The Harbour Police launch is approaching. Their blue lights are reflecting off the hull. It’s a grim sight.
It was a tragic accident. He was helping me with a rope. A huge swell just hit us out of nowhere.
The police are waiting for us at the quay. They’re going to want detailed statements from everyone.
I just found Liam’s phone in Marcus’s jacket pocket. What is going on?
That’s— It’s not what it looks like. I can explain. I swear.
Then say what it is, Marcus, because this looks absolutely awful. You need to start talking. Now.
Everyone just take a deep breath. We need to be precise and calm for the officers. Panicking won't help.
Officers boarding. Phones away.
We're in the station lounge. The officers want a clean and precise timeline from all of us. No discrepancies.
They’ve split us up. We’re not supposed to be talking to each other. Texting isn’t talking, right?
The detective with the navy blue tie keeps asking who touched what, and exactly when. He's very methodical.
The waiting room vending machine just ate my coins. This place is somehow colder than the ferry was.
They want to take our phones for a bit-by-bit copy. Is that a normal procedure? It feels invasive.
Officer said the earlier 18:21 alert was an unattended bag alarm at the quay. Logged and cleared.
DM: The bruise on Liam’s wrist was thin and circumferential. Like a line, not a thick rope. Important detail.
DM: The impression had a uniform depth. It wasn't frayed. That rules out a hemp or nylon mooring rope.
DM: So, a thin line under extreme tension. Got it. I'll remember that. Thanks, Priya.
I had my recorder on near the stern at 18:50. It might have caught some background voices or sounds.
I remember hearing a metallic rattle, then the wind, and then someone saying “careful” very quietly.
DM: Was your recorder’s time synced? The phone network should have it pretty close to accurate.
DM: It auto-syncs. It should be within a few seconds at the absolute worst. It’s reliable.
They asked me about the backpack. Who was the first person to see it? They're focusing on that.
I was. Black canvas, with paint flecks on the strap. I made a point not to touch it.
An officer took a statement from me about it around 19:20. They’re checking the lost property logs.
They also asked who walked past it the most. That could have been any one of us. We were all over the deck.
I did. It was under the stern bench. Liam specifically told me to leave it for lost property.
They keep circling back to why Liam’s phone was in my jacket. I honestly don’t know. I’m baffled.
Maybe he asked you to hold it for a moment? People do that when they're taking photos. It's plausible.
He wouldn’t give up his phone in the middle of a shift. He logs everything on it. It was his lifeline.
When the ferry lurched, his phone slid by my boot near the rail. I grabbed it and shoved it in my jacket to keep it dry.
I saw Marcus pick something up then. I thought it was trash. It could have been the phone.
That at least explains the pocket. Say it the same way to the detectives.
DM: Did you put Liam’s phone in my jacket? Why on earth was it there? I need to know.
DM: What? No. Of course not. I found it, I told you that. Don't accuse me.
DM: When exactly did you find it? Before or after the alarm went off? The timing is critical.
DM: After. It was near the rail. It buzzed in your pocket, I checked it, and then I handed it up. That's all.
He told me at 18:30, "there’s a package to log later." He didn’t say who it was for. He seemed nervous.
A "package" could mean the backpack. Or it could be a crate on the quay. It's too vague.
Did he say who told him about it? The captain? Another crew member? A contractor maybe?
No. He just said "later." He looked… conflicted. Like he was caught in the middle of something.
I never asked him to do anything illegal tonight. We argued, yes. But it wasn't about work. It was personal.
What was it about, then? Don't hold back now, Marcus. We need to know.
He wanted to back out of something we had planned. I told him to just wait until the morning.
Morning would have been so much kinder to all of us. This is a nightmare.
DM: Is the USB still locked? Any progress on that front?
DM: Yeah, it's phrase-based. Whoever set this up had a flair for the dramatic, and some serious skills.
DM: They asked me about a "consulting" payment. Did you mention it to them?
DM: Not yet. We need to keep it vague until we understand the full picture. Don't give them everything.
They’re calling us back in, one by one, again. I think I’m next. I’m so tired.
Note: their timeline focus is between 18:49 and 18:52. That’s the critical window. We need to be precise.
Morning. I couldn't sleep at all. I'm backing up the USB image now to try some safer cracks.
Imaging it as read-only and hashing it. The chain of custody will matter if this goes formal, and it will.
DM: Keep the original sealed up tight. Only work on the copy. Journalists get sued for a lot less.
DM: Copy that. I’ll store the checksums in a separate note and print them out. A physical paper trail.
The police want us back at 11 for a follow-up. Bring anything and everything we remembered overnight. No matter how small.
They asked for our clothes from last night, in separate paper bags. Don’t wash anything yet. Forensics.
I’ll bring the raw audio recorder files. No edits, just the original timestamps. Let them hear it all.
Liam’s jacket had a faint smell of turps. Not diesel. It was an art studio kind of smell. Distinct.
DM: The scent was fresh. I was within a metre of him around 18:55, near the stairwell. I'm sure of it.
Turps could mean freshly painted surfaces or cleaned tools. That's not part of the ferry's regular maintenance routine.
Studios and art galleries are thick around the Quay. It’s hardly a smoking gun, Alex. Let's be realistic.
Half of Sydney smells like solvents. My museum stores are near paint and chemicals all day long. It's nothing.
Which donor were you cataloguing for, Sienna? Your text last night sounded… careful. Calculated, even.
It was a private trust. I catalogue the crates, not their provenance. The donor wished to remain anonymous.
DM: Meet me at Barangaroo at 9. There’s some context you need before that drive completely ruins me. Please.
I'm heading to the Barangaroo foreshore now. If I go quiet, it's because I’m with Marcus. Wish me luck.
DM: Record him if he volunteers any incriminating information. Don’t prompt him. The chain of evidence is crucial.
DM: I’ll just take contemporaneous notes. He’s spooked, not chatty. I have to handle this carefully.
Marcus says “Harbour Consulting” is a shell company we used to handle customs “facilitation.” Whatever that means.
He says it was to “smooth over any delays.” Nothing about the contents. But a lot about the fees involved.
Did Liam know that these fees existed? Was he involved in that part of it?
That’s just a fancy way of saying bribes. Screenshots or it didn’t happen, Alex. We need proof.
I’ll show the statements to the detectives, not here in a group chat. I’m done texting potential evidence.
It all just got away from me. But I didn’t touch Liam. I swear on my life.
He threatened to go public with what he knew. That gives you a motive. It doesn’t prove the means, though.
I argued with words, not with my fists. I walked away from him at 18:49. A crew member can confirm that.
DM: That narrow bruise means a thin line under a lot of tension. It could be fishing line. Strong fishing line.
DM: A wire would have cut deeper. So monofilament or something similar. Would you agree with that?
DM: It’s likely. The depth was shallow and perfectly circumferential. A sharp snap and jerk fits the evidence.
What about the backpack inventory? Did anyone hear what was actually inside it? The contents are key.
I zoomed in on the photo: the brand tag says “Seacrest.” I can ring around and check for local stockists.
The EXIF data shows ISO 3200, at 18:50:39. We can line that up perfectly with Zoe’s audio recording.
Explicit: Photo 18:50:39 vs audio snap 18:50:34. Five‑second delta, consistent with camera clock drift.
We are not the police. We should share all of this at 11 and let them do their jobs and handle it.
The officer said it contained "gloves, a line, and a utility knife, nothing explosive." That's all I know.
Did they specify the type of gloves? Blue nitrile? That’s what evidence technicians use. A crucial detail.
The officer mentioned blue nitrile gloves. And the line spool was small, high-test fishing grade. Very strong.
Just out of the debrief. The detective kept circling the times between 18:49 and 18:52. They're closing in.
He asked specifically who was standing closest to the stern rail at exactly 18:50. He's looking for an opportunity.
I told them Sienna was there for a moment. Then Alex, and then me. We were all there at some point.
That’s exactly when the ferry slowed down near Kirribilli and the jacket was found by the rail. The timing is damning.
He asked about a metallic snap sound. I mentioned that Zoe’s audio might have captured it.
I handed them the SD card. They’re going to image it and then return a copy to me. Standard procedure.
I was on the lower deck at that point. Nausea. The crew saw me there. I have an alibi.
The deckhand with the yellow gloves can vouch for me. He even offered me a glass of water.
The detective asked for his name. None of us caught it. He was just a face in the chaos. A ghost.
Update: crew list shows the deckhand was Jax Morgan. Yellow gloves guy has a name now.
I asked about the drug screens. They came back negative for any sedatives. So it wasn’t a push and not a dose.
They’re still waiting on the full toxicology report, but the preliminary results are clear. No foul play there.
So it was the mechanism, not chemistry. The fishing line theory is holding up. It’s the most logical explanation.
The USB headers show an encrypted volume with a custom label. It’s stylish, and annoyingly clever.
I didn’t mount it. I just looked at the metadata. They were happy about that. I didn't tamper with evidence.
DM: Good. That way they can’t claim you tampered with anything. Smart move, Alex.
DM: Can you see the full label without unlocking the drive? Any clues there?
DM: Only a partial. It says VOL-SAI… and then it’s just garbled. It could be an in-joke or a code.
DM: Keep that between us for now. It could be our ace in the hole. Don't share it with the others yet.
DM: It's only “VOL-” and then gibberish. It could be themed. Something artsy. Someone with a creative flair.
Everything you touch doesn’t automatically become evidence just because it’s pretty, Alex. Stop reaching.
Focus on how Liam fell, not on my old file names. That’s what’s important right now. A man is dead.
Artsy doesn’t equal guilty. Don’t you dare do that. You’re grasping at straws and pointing fingers.
The detective said they’ll inspect the ferry rail at low tide tomorrow. They're looking for physical evidence.
If they don’t do a thorough job, we will. Photos, measurements, the works. We owe it to Liam.
Detective Barber just texted: “No touching. If you’re there first, photos only, chalk for scale. We’ll supervise if we can.”
Copy. Photos under instruction. No removing anything.
I might have a breakthrough. I tried “HarbourLights” again: nothing. But then something else just clicked into place.
The volume label fragment looked like “SAILS…”. So, I tried a phrase from last night. A long shot.
You used Sienna’s poetic line? That’s… a pointed accusation, Alex. You better be sure about this.
What was the exact phrase you used? Don't leave us hanging. This could be it.
If this is some kind of sick joke, it isn’t funny at all. You’re playing with fire, Alex.
“the sails look like they’re breathing” — typed exactly as she said it last night. Verbatim.
It mounted a hidden volume. The root directory has documents and a chat export. It’s all here.
First glance: file named INV_HC_041_curation.pdf. That label again.
Share the filenames, not the files themselves, here. We’ll hand the entire drive in. No more secrets.
We used that “sails” line as a silly in‑group password months ago for a shared photo dump. It wasn’t meant to implicate anyone.
That’s just something I said about the city lights. It’s not a digital signature. This is ridiculous.
It was a shared passphrase. Not just mine. Not Sienna’s alone. We all used it for... things.
I reused it for the USB because I’m lazy. I set the label; Sienna didn’t touch the config.
Inside: invoices, shipping manifests, and a detailed chat log. “HC” pays “Deckie.” The dates match Liam’s shifts perfectly.
One manifest: crate 4B-KIR, transfer scheduled for “after the lights,” handler listed as: Deckie. It's all laid out.
A chat excerpt mentions a “white bay lock-up” and a “curation receipt.” This is getting deeper and deeper.
“After lights” matches our ferry time window exactly. This was all supposed to happen last night.
“Deckie” was Liam’s code name. He moved sealed crates from the quay to a storage unit. They were legal goods. I thought.
He was paid above board through HC. It was stupid and traceable, I know that now. I wasn't thinking straight.
There’s a consignment note to a White Bay lock-up with a curator’s signature. Sienna? Care to explain?
I wrote receipts for condition checks on the items, not to hide anything. That's my job. It's what I do.
The note says “temporary storage pending provenance confirmation.” That’s a massive red flag in the art world.
I catalogued some art pieces for a private donor. That’s it. You’re twisting my words and my actions.
We’ll let the detectives pull on these threads. But the origin of the passphrase is what matters now. It's a direct link.
All of this speculation still doesn’t answer the most important question: how did he fall? We need to focus on that.
It narrows down why someone might have wanted to set a trap for him. The motive is becoming clearer.
I didn’t do it. Say it again if you must, but I didn't. I'm innocent of that, at least.
I'm tracing the payments now. “Harbour Consulting” funnels money to a company called “SB Holdings” via two neobanks.
The intermediate accounts are Pacific One and TideWave. It’s a round-trip payment within 48 hours. Classic money laundering.
Out of order timestamps? That's a red flag. Screenshot everything before they have a chance to vanish.
“SB” as in Sienna Blake? That’s not exactly subtle, is it? A bit on the nose.
Or Southbound. Or Sandstone Bridge. Shell companies love using initials; that much is true. It means nothing.
The articles of incorporation for SB Holdings list a trustee. I’ll forward all of this to the police. They can untangle it.
Shells name things after their owners' initials all the time. Ask Marcus about his own company. It's common practice.
Mine was called MC Logistics. Subtle as a brick, I know. I was young and foolish. We all make mistakes.
The detectives are going to love this pattern. The motive is getting very crowded. This is a tangled web.
I can’t defend the accounts. It was stupid. But I didn’t kill him. He threatened to go public; I panicked, I wasn't violent.
I told him to just wait. We could have exited cleanly. But he said “tonight or never.” He was determined.
And now he’s gone forever. Everyone has to sit with that. There are real consequences to our actions.
DM: Liam texted me last week: “If I vanish, take a close look at the stern rail screws.” A warning.
DM: He added “I can’t skip that path; duty requires a stern sweep each run. Might just be loose hardware.”
DM: He knew something specific was wrong with that rail. Maybe he was trying to warn us about a trap.
DM: That’s incredibly specific. We absolutely need photos of that rail at low tide. No matter what.
DM: I’ll bring a ruler and some chalk. We can mark any scuffs without actually touching anything. Preserve the evidence.
Tomorrow at noon looks like the lowest tide. Let's meet at the Kirribilli steps. We need to do this for Liam.
I’ll bring gloves and a camera with a macro lens. We need to document everything perfectly.
I’ve been checking injury patterns. A sudden jerk could have easily flipped him over if a line snagged his wrist unexpectedly.
The angle of his fall would have been backwards, toward the water, if he was pulled at wrist height. It all fits.
The rail height and Liam’s own height make that a feasible scenario. It’s a perfect storm of factors.
The backpack had monofilament line. The thin kind designed for high tension, it's almost invisible in the dark.
Monofilament bites into the skin cleanly. My fisher uncles used to warn me about it all the time. It’s nasty stuff.
Which perfectly matches the uniform bruise I saw on his wrist. This is no accident. It was a setup.
So, a freak fishing accident? You are all making up wild conspiracies in the middle of the harbour.
An accident doesn’t pre-tie a high-tension line to a ferry rail, Sienna. That's premeditated.
And it certainly doesn’t leave scuff marks that are aligned like a guide. This was carefully planned.
I argued with him about refusing to do another run for me. I walked away. That’s the absolute truth.
He said, “no more crates.” I said, “we’ll talk about it tomorrow.” He left angry, and that was the last time I saw him.
We all left angry last night. Context matters. Emotions were running high for everyone.
Crew SOP has deckhands do a stern sweep around 18:50 on that route. He had to go back there.
The CCTV footage near the stern has a convenient blind strip. But my audio picks up a distinct snap at 18:50:34, and then a gasp.
A blind spot plus a nearly invisible line equals premeditation, not a simple stumble. It's murder.
Let’s verify everything with the rail photos at noon today. We need undeniable proof before we go to the police.
Camera 3 flares when the ferry turns east; mast vibration + cabin lights make a 20‑second glare window. Someone knew that.
That snap sound could be the line under tension. If someone deliberately set a trap at the rail…
…they knew the swell patterns and Liam’s exact route on the deck during his shift. It was an inside job.
Or they just panicked and did something incredibly stupid. People do that all the time. It doesn't have to be a grand conspiracy.
Mechanism fits: line jerk → fall over stern → cold shock on immersion. No drugs needed for collapse.
We're at the Kirribilli wharf now, at low tide. The stern rail screws have fresh scuff marks on them. Just as Liam predicted.
Chalk marks have been laid. I'm photographing everything with a scale for reference. Do not touch anything.
Gloves are on. I’ll handle the ruler for the close-up shots. We need to be meticulous.
Texted Barber our location. He okayed photos only and said an officer may swing by to supervise.
I'm sending the pics to the group now. There’s a faint but definite groove where a line could have been seated.
The groove depth is about 0.5 mm. It's consistent over a 6 cm length. This is our smoking gun.
There’s also a tiny, almost translucent filament caught right under a screw head. I almost missed it.
It matches the width of the bruise perfectly. Whoever prepped this knew the ferry and the swell like the back of their hand.
I'm collecting the filament into a sterile envelope. A chain of custody photo has been taken. We're doing this by the book.
Do not remove the screw itself. Just the loose strand of filament. We can't risk compromising the evidence.
Officer Patel just arrived. Logged our photos, bagged the envelope, said our handling makes it a lead, not primary evidence.
Liam would have noticed a visible rope. But monofilament is nearly invisible at night, especially with the harbour lights.
The photos clearly show how it could have been at wrist height if it was tied from below the railing. A perfect trap.
There are no knot marks. It looks like a wrap-and-wedge technique against the screw shaft. Quick and effective.
The last piece of the puzzle: whoever had the backpack also had the line. So, who handled it last night?
Liam told Alex to leave it alone. I heard him say it myself. He was very clear about it.
I have a photo of Sienna passing it on her way to get the chips. She was right there.
You did, Alex. You were the one who pointed it out to everyone in the first place. Don't forget that.
Pointing at something isn’t the same as tying a deadly trap. The photos will show who lingered by the rail.
I lingered to look at the skyline. It’s not a crime to appreciate a beautiful view. You're twisting things.
I never touched it. Liam told me to leave it alone. You bought chips and then went right past the stern bench.
The time stamps on my photos show Sienna at the rail from 18:50:10 to 18:50:28. Then Liam approaches.
And the snap from Zoe's audio was at 18:50:34. The sequence of events is incredibly tight. There's no room for error.
I saw Sienna alone at the rail at 18:50:10. I just thought she was taking photos of the city.
I was. The city looked alive. That’s all it was. You're all making something out of nothing.
The detectives will decide what's what. We’ve documented everything we can. It's in their hands now.
I found a config file on the USB with the label “SAILS_BREATHE”. That’s not a random choice of words.
It references specific export folders and a White Bay unit number. It’s a treasure trove of evidence.
The passphrase and the label both use Sienna’s exact words. That directly links her intent to all of this.
So I like metaphors. Stop trying to twist my words into a confession of guilt. This is insane.
I didn’t write that config file. Anyone could have named a file that. It proves nothing.
But the phrase unlocked the drive. That’s the part that really bothers me. It's too specific to be a coincidence.
The payments to SB Holdings are noted as “curation services.” And the White Bay unit lease is in your family trust, Sienna.
That trust predates any of this. My aunt set it up years ago. It holds the lease, that's all. It's perfectly legal.
And the crates? Who signed the receipts for them? Was it you, Sienna? Just tell us the truth.
I routed the money. She handled the intake. Liam wanted out of the whole thing. We’re both culpable. But I didn’t set any trap.
If I could take back last night, I would. This isn’t how it was supposed to end. It all spun out of control.
It ended for Liam. That’s the only point that matters now. A good man is gone because of our choices.
DM: If I tell the whole truth, will it help Marcus at all? I need to know. He doesn't deserve to go down for this.
DM: It will help the truth come out. That’s the only thing we can control at this point. It's the right thing to do.
DM: Tell it to the group first. And then you need to tell the detectives everything. No more lies.
DM: Don’t coach her. Just let her say it in her own words. It has to be her choice.
DM: Understood. You're right. This is on her now.
I set a line at the rail to make him stop and listen to me. The swell did the rest. I tried to grab him, I swear.
I didn’t see the exact moment he went over. It all happened so fast. One second he was there, the next he was gone.
I had a pre‑cut loop palmed from that backpack. During the group photo, I wrapped and wedged it under the screw head in a second.
The flash, the wind—everyone looked forward. I thought it would just check him, make him listen. I was wrong.
That decision to set the line caused his fall. That’s what matters in the end. It was your action.
The bruise on his wrist matches your story. It was preventable. You knew the risks. You knew what could happen.
We’ll forward everything we have to the detectives now. There will be no more debate here. It's over.
I’m packaging the audio files, photos, and all of our message exports. They'll have the full picture.
I was the one who disabled a bag alarm at the quay earlier. That’s the “alarm” the ferry logged. I just needed a minute.
That ties the 18:21 delay directly to you. You need to tell them that too. Every single detail matters now.
I will. I’m done with all the hiding. It's time to face the consequences of my actions.
The detectives have the USB, all the photos, and this entire chat log. They’re on their way to you now, Sienna.
I gave them a written and signed timeline, with links to all of our media. They have everything they need.
The checksum sheet has been printed and signed. They appreciated the thoroughness of our documentation.
Detectives said our noon photos guided their scene work, but they’ll rely on their own collections in court.
I’ll give my full statement. No more shells. No more lies. I'm done with that life.
My lawyer says to cooperate fully. It’s the only viable path left for me now. I have to face the music.
Good. Transparency is the only currency that matters at this point. The truth will set you free, in a way.
I keep hearing the alarm and the sound of the water. I think I’m going to take a break from the quay for a while.
DM: How about coffee at the Rocks later? A quiet place. No view of the harbour. We could all use a break.
DM: Yes. Thank you, Alex. I’d like that very much. I could use a friend right now.
The sails of the Opera House look so still in the dawn. No breathing. Just cold, hard light.
Some truths don’t move, even when the water does. They're constant and unyielding.
I’ll text you all some updates after I’ve spoken to them. You deserve to know what happens next.
I’ll write it all straight. Liam deserves the honest truth, not some sensationalized twist. He was a good man.
No adjectives that he can’t argue with, wherever he is now. Just the facts. He deserves that much.
I’ll attend the inquest if they allow public observers. I want to see justice served for Liam.
I’ll meet them at the museum steps. I’m so sorry for everything. For all the lies and the pain I've caused.
Tell the truth, from start to finish. It’s all that matters now. It's the only way forward.
I will. I'll do it for Liam. He deserves at least that much from me.

The harbour looks electric — and I don’t mean the lights. Circular Quay, Wharf 3, 6pm. Don’t be late.
On shift. Can slip us onto the 6:30 Manly ferry. Best view of the city turning on.
If we’re playing tour guide, someone better bring some decent gossip. I’ve got a lead that's burning a hole in my notes.
Save it for another time, Zoe. Let’s just try to enjoy the lights for what they are.
Come on now, a truce for tonight. I’m determined to get photos of the Opera House sails from mid-harbour.
I’m in. Clinic ran late so I have to leave by 8. Long day.
Let's meet by the bronze seal statue. It's easier to spot in the crowd.
I’ll bring my tiny recorder. The ambient sounds of the ferry make for great B-roll. You never know.
Bringing fingerless gloves. It’s freezing but I refuse to hide my new nails. A girl has her priorities.
I can grab some ginger tablets on my way. Seasick prevention for the weak-willed among us.
Ha. Just wait till a southerly hits. You’ll be worshipping those little tablets then.
Text me if you’re running behind. I still have to return some scrubs first.
DM: You saw Marcus’s Harbour Consulting transfer, right? Meet me at Wharf 3. Quietly.
DM: I’ve got a clipped invoice name: INV‑HC‑041 — “curation services.”
DM: Don’t put that in writing. Meet you at Wharf 3. We need to talk.
DM: Bring that USB you borrowed. I need it back tonight. No excuses.
DM: You said it was just backup photos from the hackathon. Why the sudden rush?
Heads up: the ferry's delayed. Some alarm went off earlier at the quay. We should be good for 6:45 now.
PA just asked folks to move forward for boarding checks. Stern deck is pretty empty right now.
Busker on the quay has a crowd facing away from Wharf 3. Good window for the crew to reset things.
I'm at Wharf 3 under the big clock. The wind is absolutely freezing out here.
Here with hot chips. Don't be late or they'll be gone. Sharing is caring, but I have my limits.
There's a street busker outside the Museum of Contemporary Art playing Crowded House. Quintessentially Sydney.
Just snapped the Harbour Bridge through a puddle. A perfect reflex mirror of steel and sky.
The queue at Wharf 3 is long but it’s moving. I’ll hold a few spots for us.
Wave if you see me. I'm in the high-vis jacket and a blue beanie. Can't miss me.
Buying a scarf from the kiosk. This wind is savage. I should have dressed warmer.
Extra chips for sharing. No flaking on me now, people.
A ferry horn just made a kid cry and then immediately laugh. I kind of know the feeling.
Noticing a fire boat near the quay. Lights are on but no siren. Strange.
Onboard now, top deck. The city looks electric from here. Truly something else.
Smells like salt and something metallic, like battery acid. I love it.
Stay clear of the yellow lines, everyone. The deck gets surprisingly slick out here. Safety first.
Recorder is rolling. Say something poetic for me, Sienna. Don't be shy.
The sails are breathing tonight.
That’s poetic enough. Just don’t drop that expensive recorder overboard.
Also, for your information: that USB is encrypted. Marcus, what’s actually on it? This is getting weird.
Drop it. Enjoy the view.
Forget the drive. The sails look like they’re breathing tonight. It’s unreal.
Someone’s left a backpack under the bench by the stern. Anyone see who it belongs to?
Photo attached: It’s a black canvas bag, with paint flecks on the strap. Looks familiar.
Did anyone see who might have left it there? We should probably let someone know.
Probably just a tourist. Leave it for lost property. I’ll log it when we dock. No stress.
DM: Want me to move it closer to the wall, out of the way?
DM: Nah, just leave it exactly where it is. I’ll tag it properly later. Thanks though.
Focus, people: the fireworks reflection on the glass towers. That's some unreal bokeh. A photographer's dream.
DM: Your hands are shaking. Are you okay? You seem on edge.
DM: It’s been a long shift. The wind just cuts right through you out here on the water.
DM: So, are we good for that package or not? I need to know.
DM: Not over text. We'll talk about it later. End of discussion.
Okay, quick group photo and then everyone pockets their phones. Let's live a little, shall we?
Timer is set for 3 seconds. Everyone squeeze in and try to look happy!
The wind just stole my beanie. A seagull owes me $20. The audacity.
Posting to our chat only. No public tags, please. Let's keep this one for us.
The harbour is glassing over now. The reflection looks like it’s breathing. So serene.
DM: You and your beautiful metaphors. Keep them coming. They're the highlight of my night.
The ferry just slowed down near Kirribilli. There are police lights along the shore. What’s going on?
Marcus, where did you disappear to? You were just here.
He’s on the lower deck. He said he was feeling sick all of a sudden.
I’m fine, really. Just needed some fresh air and fewer pointed questions. It was getting intense.
DM: Keep an eye on that bag. A crew member keeps glancing at it. Something's not right.
DM: Which one? The one with the yellow gloves and the shaved head?
DM: Yep, that's the one. He's the same guy Liam was chatting with earlier. I have a bad feeling.
The wind’s really picking up now. Hold onto the rails if you’re moving around. Seriously.
The Opera House is behind us now. The bridge towers look like ancient watchmen in the dark.
I still can’t unlock this USB. It keeps asking for a passphrase. What are you hiding, Marcus?
Try ‘HarbourLights’. It’s worth a shot. People are often predictable.
No luck. Phrase prompt persists. Strong encryption.
DM: Delete anything and everything you saw. Please. For your own good.
DM: What in the world did you drag us into, Marcus? This is serious.
DM: Not here. People listen on boats. Bring the USB tomorrow. We need to talk, face to face.
DM: He’s completely dodging. If I suddenly vanish, publish everything you have. I’m not kidding.
DM: Don’t be so dramatic. But yes, everything is backed up. I've got your back.
Did anyone else just feel the ferry lurch a bit? That was a strange jolt.
Wait, where’s Liam? Has anyone seen him in the last few minutes?
I thought he went to talk to the captain about something. He looked stressed.
There’s a jacket by the rail near the stern. It looks just like his. Oh my god.
Call triple zero right now! Someone’s gone overboard! This is not a drill!
I’m pulling the emergency alarm right now. Stay calm, everyone.
Throw the ring buoy! Port side! I can’t see him in the water. It’s too dark.
Triple zero is on speaker. They’re alerting the Marine Area Command immediately. Help is on the way.
The crew is deploying a ladder. I’m scanning the water with my flashlight. The waves are like black glass.
I hear a strange banging sound from below. Is it the engine room? Or the hull slapping against something?
I’m on the lower deck, starboard side. No sighting of him yet. I'm looking as hard as I can.
They’re bringing someone up onto the deck. It’s Liam. He looks… oh god.
I’m with the crew now. I'm starting compressions. Give us some space, please!
His pupils are unresponsive. There's no pulse. I… I’m so incredibly sorry, everyone. He's gone.
The crew is logging the incident time. Approximately 19:05. Cold shock was likely a factor. Keep the space clear.
Recording incident details. Footing slick at stern rail.
There’s a thin, sharp mark on his wrist. It looks like a fishing line burn. How did that get there?
DM: Marcus was arguing with him by the stern no more than ten minutes ago. I saw it.
DM: I saw a fresh bruise on Liam’s wrist earlier tonight. I should have said something.
DM: That lines up with the sharp snap I think I heard on my recording. Save all your notes. Every detail matters now.
Cover him with blankets. Please, keep the curious onlookers back. Show some respect.
The Harbour Police launch is approaching. Their blue lights are reflecting off the hull. It’s a grim sight.
It was a tragic accident. He was helping me with a rope. A huge swell just hit us out of nowhere.
The police are waiting for us at the quay. They’re going to want detailed statements from everyone.
I just found Liam’s phone in Marcus’s jacket pocket. What is going on?
That’s— It’s not what it looks like. I can explain. I swear.
Then say what it is, Marcus, because this looks absolutely awful. You need to start talking. Now.
Everyone just take a deep breath. We need to be precise and calm for the officers. Panicking won't help.
Officers boarding. Phones away.

The detective with the navy blue tie keeps asking who touched what, and exactly when. He's very methodical.
The waiting room vending machine just ate my coins. This place is somehow colder than the ferry was.
They want to take our phones for a bit-by-bit copy. Is that a normal procedure? It feels invasive.
Officer said the earlier 18:21 alert was an unattended bag alarm at the quay. Logged and cleared.

DM: So, a thin line under extreme tension. Got it. I'll remember that. Thanks, Priya.
I had my recorder on near the stern at 18:50. It might have caught some background voices or sounds.

DM: Was your recorder’s time synced? The phone network should have it pretty close to accurate.
DM: It auto-syncs. It should be within a few seconds at the absolute worst. It’s reliable.
They asked me about the backpack. Who was the first person to see it? They're focusing on that.
I was. Black canvas, with paint flecks on the strap. I made a point not to touch it.
An officer took a statement from me about it around 19:20. They’re checking the lost property logs.
They also asked who walked past it the most. That could have been any one of us. We were all over the deck.
I did. It was under the stern bench. Liam specifically told me to leave it for lost property.
They keep circling back to why Liam’s phone was in my jacket. I honestly don’t know. I’m baffled.
Maybe he asked you to hold it for a moment? People do that when they're taking photos. It's plausible.
He wouldn’t give up his phone in the middle of a shift. He logs everything on it. It was his lifeline.
When the ferry lurched, his phone slid by my boot near the rail. I grabbed it and shoved it in my jacket to keep it dry.
I saw Marcus pick something up then. I thought it was trash. It could have been the phone.
That at least explains the pocket. Say it the same way to the detectives.
DM: Did you put Liam’s phone in my jacket? Why on earth was it there? I need to know.
DM: What? No. Of course not. I found it, I told you that. Don't accuse me.
DM: When exactly did you find it? Before or after the alarm went off? The timing is critical.
DM: After. It was near the rail. It buzzed in your pocket, I checked it, and then I handed it up. That's all.
He told me at 18:30, "there’s a package to log later." He didn’t say who it was for. He seemed nervous.
A "package" could mean the backpack. Or it could be a crate on the quay. It's too vague.
Did he say who told him about it? The captain? Another crew member? A contractor maybe?
No. He just said "later." He looked… conflicted. Like he was caught in the middle of something.
I never asked him to do anything illegal tonight. We argued, yes. But it wasn't about work. It was personal.
What was it about, then? Don't hold back now, Marcus. We need to know.
He wanted to back out of something we had planned. I told him to just wait until the morning.
Morning would have been so much kinder to all of us. This is a nightmare.
DM: Is the USB still locked? Any progress on that front?
DM: Yeah, it's phrase-based. Whoever set this up had a flair for the dramatic, and some serious skills.
DM: They asked me about a "consulting" payment. Did you mention it to them?
DM: Not yet. We need to keep it vague until we understand the full picture. Don't give them everything.
They’re calling us back in, one by one, again. I think I’m next. I’m so tired.
Note: their timeline focus is between 18:49 and 18:52. That’s the critical window. We need to be precise.
We're in the station lounge. The officers want a clean and precise timeline from all of us. No discrepancies.

Morning. I couldn't sleep at all. I'm backing up the USB image now to try some safer cracks.
Imaging it as read-only and hashing it. The chain of custody will matter if this goes formal, and it will.
DM: Keep the original sealed up tight. Only work on the copy. Journalists get sued for a lot less.
DM: Copy that. I’ll store the checksums in a separate note and print them out. A physical paper trail.
The police want us back at 11 for a follow-up. Bring anything and everything we remembered overnight. No matter how small.
They asked for our clothes from last night, in separate paper bags. Don’t wash anything yet. Forensics.
I’ll bring the raw audio recorder files. No edits, just the original timestamps. Let them hear it all.
Liam’s jacket had a faint smell of turps. Not diesel. It was an art studio kind of smell. Distinct.
DM: The scent was fresh. I was within a metre of him around 18:55, near the stairwell. I'm sure of it.
Turps could mean freshly painted surfaces or cleaned tools. That's not part of the ferry's regular maintenance routine.
Studios and art galleries are thick around the Quay. It’s hardly a smoking gun, Alex. Let's be realistic.
Half of Sydney smells like solvents. My museum stores are near paint and chemicals all day long. It's nothing.
Which donor were you cataloguing for, Sienna? Your text last night sounded… careful. Calculated, even.
It was a private trust. I catalogue the crates, not their provenance. The donor wished to remain anonymous.
DM: Meet me at Barangaroo at 9. There’s some context you need before that drive completely ruins me. Please.
I'm heading to the Barangaroo foreshore now. If I go quiet, it's because I’m with Marcus. Wish me luck.
DM: Record him if he volunteers any incriminating information. Don’t prompt him. The chain of evidence is crucial.
DM: I’ll just take contemporaneous notes. He’s spooked, not chatty. I have to handle this carefully.
Marcus says “Harbour Consulting” is a shell company we used to handle customs “facilitation.” Whatever that means.
He says it was to “smooth over any delays.” Nothing about the contents. But a lot about the fees involved.
Did Liam know that these fees existed? Was he involved in that part of it?
That’s just a fancy way of saying bribes. Screenshots or it didn’t happen, Alex. We need proof.
I’ll show the statements to the detectives, not here in a group chat. I’m done texting potential evidence.
It all just got away from me. But I didn’t touch Liam. I swear on my life.
He threatened to go public with what he knew. That gives you a motive. It doesn’t prove the means, though.
I argued with words, not with my fists. I walked away from him at 18:49. A crew member can confirm that.
DM: That narrow bruise means a thin line under a lot of tension. It could be fishing line. Strong fishing line.
DM: A wire would have cut deeper. So monofilament or something similar. Would you agree with that?
DM: It’s likely. The depth was shallow and perfectly circumferential. A sharp snap and jerk fits the evidence.
What about the backpack inventory? Did anyone hear what was actually inside it? The contents are key.
I zoomed in on the photo: the brand tag says “Seacrest.” I can ring around and check for local stockists.
The EXIF data shows ISO 3200, at 18:50:39. We can line that up perfectly with Zoe’s audio recording.
Explicit: Photo 18:50:39 vs audio snap 18:50:34. Five‑second delta, consistent with camera clock drift.
We are not the police. We should share all of this at 11 and let them do their jobs and handle it.
The officer said it contained "gloves, a line, and a utility knife, nothing explosive." That's all I know.
Did they specify the type of gloves? Blue nitrile? That’s what evidence technicians use. A crucial detail.
The officer mentioned blue nitrile gloves. And the line spool was small, high-test fishing grade. Very strong.

Just out of the debrief. The detective kept circling the times between 18:49 and 18:52. They're closing in.
He asked specifically who was standing closest to the stern rail at exactly 18:50. He's looking for an opportunity.
I told them Sienna was there for a moment. Then Alex, and then me. We were all there at some point.
That’s exactly when the ferry slowed down near Kirribilli and the jacket was found by the rail. The timing is damning.
He asked about a metallic snap sound. I mentioned that Zoe’s audio might have captured it.
I handed them the SD card. They’re going to image it and then return a copy to me. Standard procedure.
I was on the lower deck at that point. Nausea. The crew saw me there. I have an alibi.
The deckhand with the yellow gloves can vouch for me. He even offered me a glass of water.
The detective asked for his name. None of us caught it. He was just a face in the chaos. A ghost.
Update: crew list shows the deckhand was Jax Morgan. Yellow gloves guy has a name now.
I asked about the drug screens. They came back negative for any sedatives. So it wasn’t a push and not a dose.
They’re still waiting on the full toxicology report, but the preliminary results are clear. No foul play there.
So it was the mechanism, not chemistry. The fishing line theory is holding up. It’s the most logical explanation.
The USB headers show an encrypted volume with a custom label. It’s stylish, and annoyingly clever.
I didn’t mount it. I just looked at the metadata. They were happy about that. I didn't tamper with evidence.
DM: Good. That way they can’t claim you tampered with anything. Smart move, Alex.
DM: Can you see the full label without unlocking the drive? Any clues there?
DM: Only a partial. It says VOL-SAI… and then it’s just garbled. It could be an in-joke or a code.
DM: Keep that between us for now. It could be our ace in the hole. Don't share it with the others yet.
DM: It's only “VOL-” and then gibberish. It could be themed. Something artsy. Someone with a creative flair.
Everything you touch doesn’t automatically become evidence just because it’s pretty, Alex. Stop reaching.
Focus on how Liam fell, not on my old file names. That’s what’s important right now. A man is dead.
Artsy doesn’t equal guilty. Don’t you dare do that. You’re grasping at straws and pointing fingers.
The detective said they’ll inspect the ferry rail at low tide tomorrow. They're looking for physical evidence.
If they don’t do a thorough job, we will. Photos, measurements, the works. We owe it to Liam.
Detective Barber just texted: “No touching. If you’re there first, photos only, chalk for scale. We’ll supervise if we can.”
Copy. Photos under instruction. No removing anything.

I might have a breakthrough. I tried “HarbourLights” again: nothing. But then something else just clicked into place.
The volume label fragment looked like “SAILS…”. So, I tried a phrase from last night. A long shot.
You used Sienna’s poetic line? That’s… a pointed accusation, Alex. You better be sure about this.
What was the exact phrase you used? Don't leave us hanging. This could be it.
If this is some kind of sick joke, it isn’t funny at all. You’re playing with fire, Alex.
“the sails look like they’re breathing” — typed exactly as she said it last night. Verbatim.
It mounted a hidden volume. The root directory has documents and a chat export. It’s all here.
First glance: file named INV_HC_041_curation.pdf. That label again.
Share the filenames, not the files themselves, here. We’ll hand the entire drive in. No more secrets.
We used that “sails” line as a silly in‑group password months ago for a shared photo dump. It wasn’t meant to implicate anyone.
That’s just something I said about the city lights. It’s not a digital signature. This is ridiculous.
It was a shared passphrase. Not just mine. Not Sienna’s alone. We all used it for... things.
I reused it for the USB because I’m lazy. I set the label; Sienna didn’t touch the config.
Inside: invoices, shipping manifests, and a detailed chat log. “HC” pays “Deckie.” The dates match Liam’s shifts perfectly.
One manifest: crate 4B-KIR, transfer scheduled for “after the lights,” handler listed as: Deckie. It's all laid out.
A chat excerpt mentions a “white bay lock-up” and a “curation receipt.” This is getting deeper and deeper.
“After lights” matches our ferry time window exactly. This was all supposed to happen last night.
“Deckie” was Liam’s code name. He moved sealed crates from the quay to a storage unit. They were legal goods. I thought.
He was paid above board through HC. It was stupid and traceable, I know that now. I wasn't thinking straight.
There’s a consignment note to a White Bay lock-up with a curator’s signature. Sienna? Care to explain?
I wrote receipts for condition checks on the items, not to hide anything. That's my job. It's what I do.
The note says “temporary storage pending provenance confirmation.” That’s a massive red flag in the art world.
I catalogued some art pieces for a private donor. That’s it. You’re twisting my words and my actions.
We’ll let the detectives pull on these threads. But the origin of the passphrase is what matters now. It's a direct link.
All of this speculation still doesn’t answer the most important question: how did he fall? We need to focus on that.
It narrows down why someone might have wanted to set a trap for him. The motive is becoming clearer.
I didn’t do it. Say it again if you must, but I didn't. I'm innocent of that, at least.

I'm tracing the payments now. “Harbour Consulting” funnels money to a company called “SB Holdings” via two neobanks.
The intermediate accounts are Pacific One and TideWave. It’s a round-trip payment within 48 hours. Classic money laundering.
Out of order timestamps? That's a red flag. Screenshot everything before they have a chance to vanish.
“SB” as in Sienna Blake? That’s not exactly subtle, is it? A bit on the nose.
Or Southbound. Or Sandstone Bridge. Shell companies love using initials; that much is true. It means nothing.
The articles of incorporation for SB Holdings list a trustee. I’ll forward all of this to the police. They can untangle it.
Shells name things after their owners' initials all the time. Ask Marcus about his own company. It's common practice.
Mine was called MC Logistics. Subtle as a brick, I know. I was young and foolish. We all make mistakes.
The detectives are going to love this pattern. The motive is getting very crowded. This is a tangled web.
I can’t defend the accounts. It was stupid. But I didn’t kill him. He threatened to go public; I panicked, I wasn't violent.
I told him to just wait. We could have exited cleanly. But he said “tonight or never.” He was determined.
And now he’s gone forever. Everyone has to sit with that. There are real consequences to our actions.
DM: Liam texted me last week: “If I vanish, take a close look at the stern rail screws.” A warning.
DM: He added “I can’t skip that path; duty requires a stern sweep each run. Might just be loose hardware.”
DM: He knew something specific was wrong with that rail. Maybe he was trying to warn us about a trap.
DM: That’s incredibly specific. We absolutely need photos of that rail at low tide. No matter what.
DM: I’ll bring a ruler and some chalk. We can mark any scuffs without actually touching anything. Preserve the evidence.
Tomorrow at noon looks like the lowest tide. Let's meet at the Kirribilli steps. We need to do this for Liam.
I’ll bring gloves and a camera with a macro lens. We need to document everything perfectly.

I’ve been checking injury patterns. A sudden jerk could have easily flipped him over if a line snagged his wrist unexpectedly.
The angle of his fall would have been backwards, toward the water, if he was pulled at wrist height. It all fits.
The rail height and Liam’s own height make that a feasible scenario. It’s a perfect storm of factors.
The backpack had monofilament line. The thin kind designed for high tension, it's almost invisible in the dark.
Monofilament bites into the skin cleanly. My fisher uncles used to warn me about it all the time. It’s nasty stuff.
Which perfectly matches the uniform bruise I saw on his wrist. This is no accident. It was a setup.
So, a freak fishing accident? You are all making up wild conspiracies in the middle of the harbour.
An accident doesn’t pre-tie a high-tension line to a ferry rail, Sienna. That's premeditated.
And it certainly doesn’t leave scuff marks that are aligned like a guide. This was carefully planned.
I argued with him about refusing to do another run for me. I walked away. That’s the absolute truth.
He said, “no more crates.” I said, “we’ll talk about it tomorrow.” He left angry, and that was the last time I saw him.
We all left angry last night. Context matters. Emotions were running high for everyone.
Crew SOP has deckhands do a stern sweep around 18:50 on that route. He had to go back there.
The CCTV footage near the stern has a convenient blind strip. But my audio picks up a distinct snap at 18:50:34, and then a gasp.
A blind spot plus a nearly invisible line equals premeditation, not a simple stumble. It's murder.
Let’s verify everything with the rail photos at noon today. We need undeniable proof before we go to the police.
Camera 3 flares when the ferry turns east; mast vibration + cabin lights make a 20‑second glare window. Someone knew that.
That snap sound could be the line under tension. If someone deliberately set a trap at the rail…
…they knew the swell patterns and Liam’s exact route on the deck during his shift. It was an inside job.
Or they just panicked and did something incredibly stupid. People do that all the time. It doesn't have to be a grand conspiracy.
Mechanism fits: line jerk → fall over stern → cold shock on immersion. No drugs needed for collapse.

We're at the Kirribilli wharf now, at low tide. The stern rail screws have fresh scuff marks on them. Just as Liam predicted.
Chalk marks have been laid. I'm photographing everything with a scale for reference. Do not touch anything.
Gloves are on. I’ll handle the ruler for the close-up shots. We need to be meticulous.
Texted Barber our location. He okayed photos only and said an officer may swing by to supervise.
I'm sending the pics to the group now. There’s a faint but definite groove where a line could have been seated.
The groove depth is about 0.5 mm. It's consistent over a 6 cm length. This is our smoking gun.
There’s also a tiny, almost translucent filament caught right under a screw head. I almost missed it.
It matches the width of the bruise perfectly. Whoever prepped this knew the ferry and the swell like the back of their hand.
I'm collecting the filament into a sterile envelope. A chain of custody photo has been taken. We're doing this by the book.
Do not remove the screw itself. Just the loose strand of filament. We can't risk compromising the evidence.
Officer Patel just arrived. Logged our photos, bagged the envelope, said our handling makes it a lead, not primary evidence.
Liam would have noticed a visible rope. But monofilament is nearly invisible at night, especially with the harbour lights.
The photos clearly show how it could have been at wrist height if it was tied from below the railing. A perfect trap.
There are no knot marks. It looks like a wrap-and-wedge technique against the screw shaft. Quick and effective.
The last piece of the puzzle: whoever had the backpack also had the line. So, who handled it last night?
Liam told Alex to leave it alone. I heard him say it myself. He was very clear about it.
I have a photo of Sienna passing it on her way to get the chips. She was right there.
You did, Alex. You were the one who pointed it out to everyone in the first place. Don't forget that.
Pointing at something isn’t the same as tying a deadly trap. The photos will show who lingered by the rail.
I lingered to look at the skyline. It’s not a crime to appreciate a beautiful view. You're twisting things.
I never touched it. Liam told me to leave it alone. You bought chips and then went right past the stern bench.
The time stamps on my photos show Sienna at the rail from 18:50:10 to 18:50:28. Then Liam approaches.
And the snap from Zoe's audio was at 18:50:34. The sequence of events is incredibly tight. There's no room for error.

I found a config file on the USB with the label “SAILS_BREATHE”. That’s not a random choice of words.
It references specific export folders and a White Bay unit number. It’s a treasure trove of evidence.
The passphrase and the label both use Sienna’s exact words. That directly links her intent to all of this.
So I like metaphors. Stop trying to twist my words into a confession of guilt. This is insane.
I didn’t write that config file. Anyone could have named a file that. It proves nothing.
But the phrase unlocked the drive. That’s the part that really bothers me. It's too specific to be a coincidence.
The payments to SB Holdings are noted as “curation services.” And the White Bay unit lease is in your family trust, Sienna.
That trust predates any of this. My aunt set it up years ago. It holds the lease, that's all. It's perfectly legal.
And the crates? Who signed the receipts for them? Was it you, Sienna? Just tell us the truth.
I routed the money. She handled the intake. Liam wanted out of the whole thing. We’re both culpable. But I didn’t set any trap.
If I could take back last night, I would. This isn’t how it was supposed to end. It all spun out of control.
It ended for Liam. That’s the only point that matters now. A good man is gone because of our choices.
DM: If I tell the whole truth, will it help Marcus at all? I need to know. He doesn't deserve to go down for this.
DM: It will help the truth come out. That’s the only thing we can control at this point. It's the right thing to do.
DM: Tell it to the group first. And then you need to tell the detectives everything. No more lies.
DM: Don’t coach her. Just let her say it in her own words. It has to be her choice.
DM: Understood. You're right. This is on her now.
I set a line at the rail to make him stop and listen to me. The swell did the rest. I tried to grab him, I swear.
I didn’t see the exact moment he went over. It all happened so fast. One second he was there, the next he was gone.
I had a pre‑cut loop palmed from that backpack. During the group photo, I wrapped and wedged it under the screw head in a second.
The flash, the wind—everyone looked forward. I thought it would just check him, make him listen. I was wrong.
That decision to set the line caused his fall. That’s what matters in the end. It was your action.
The bruise on his wrist matches your story. It was preventable. You knew the risks. You knew what could happen.
We’ll forward everything we have to the detectives now. There will be no more debate here. It's over.
I’m packaging the audio files, photos, and all of our message exports. They'll have the full picture.
I was the one who disabled a bag alarm at the quay earlier. That’s the “alarm” the ferry logged. I just needed a minute.
That ties the 18:21 delay directly to you. You need to tell them that too. Every single detail matters now.
I will. I’m done with all the hiding. It's time to face the consequences of my actions.
I found a config file on the USB with the label “SAILS_BREATHE”. That’s not a random choice of words.

It references specific export folders and a White Bay unit number. It’s a treasure trove of evidence.

The passphrase and the label both use Sienna’s exact words. That directly links her intent to all of this.

So I like metaphors. Stop trying to twist my words into a confession of guilt. This is insane.

I didn’t write that config file. Anyone could have named a file that. It proves nothing.

But the phrase unlocked the drive. That’s the part that really bothers me. It's too specific to be a coincidence.

The payments to SB Holdings are noted as “curation services.” And the White Bay unit lease is in your family trust, Sienna.

That trust predates any of this. My aunt set it up years ago. It holds the lease, that's all. It's perfectly legal.

The detectives have the USB, all the photos, and this entire chat log. They’re on their way to you now, Sienna.
I gave them a written and signed timeline, with links to all of our media. They have everything they need.
The checksum sheet has been printed and signed. They appreciated the thoroughness of our documentation.
Detectives said our noon photos guided their scene work, but they’ll rely on their own collections in court.
I’ll give my full statement. No more shells. No more lies. I'm done with that life.
My lawyer says to cooperate fully. It’s the only viable path left for me now. I have to face the music.
Good. Transparency is the only currency that matters at this point. The truth will set you free, in a way.
I keep hearing the alarm and the sound of the water. I think I’m going to take a break from the quay for a while.
DM: How about coffee at the Rocks later? A quiet place. No view of the harbour. We could all use a break.
DM: Yes. Thank you, Alex. I’d like that very much. I could use a friend right now.
The sails of the Opera House look so still in the dawn. No breathing. Just cold, hard light.
Some truths don’t move, even when the water does. They're constant and unyielding.
I’ll text you all some updates after I’ve spoken to them. You deserve to know what happens next.
I’ll write it all straight. Liam deserves the honest truth, not some sensationalized twist. He was a good man.
No adjectives that he can’t argue with, wherever he is now. Just the facts. He deserves that much.
I’ll attend the inquest if they allow public observers. I want to see justice served for Liam.
I’ll meet them at the museum steps. I’m so sorry for everything. For all the lies and the pain I've caused.
Tell the truth, from start to finish. It’s all that matters now. It's the only way forward.
I will. I'll do it for Liam. He deserves at least that much from me.
